I am currently a postoctoral fellow in the [School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech](https://eas.gatech.edu/) working with [Prof. Annalisa Bracco](https://eas.gatech.edu/people/bracco-dr-annalisa). 

I completed PhD in applied mathematics at the University of New Hampshire, working with [Prof John F Gibson](https://ceps.unh.edu/person/john-gibson) on transition to turbulence in shear flows. Prior to this, I was an MS student at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru, India. I worked with [Prof Alam](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/meheboob/) at JNCASR on pattern formation in compressible Taylor-Couette flow. I obtained a BE(Hons.) in mechanical engineering from BITS Pilani, India.

An overarching theme of my research so far is pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics of rotating, stratified and/or sheared flows. I am also interested in scientific computation, bifurcation theory and symmetry breaking. In near future, I would like to explore these ideas in geophysical, astrophysical and/or biological contexts.

Apart from research, I am interested in ancient cultures and martial arts. I play Tabla and a bit of Ukulele (only occasionally nowadays). I try to maintain a [blog](https://sublimeplace.wordpress.com/) where I write about things, predominantly non-academic in nature, that I find intriguing.
